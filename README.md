# Quicksort-branched-vs-unbranched
 This project compares two QuickSort implementations: na√Øve and branchless. The branchless version reduces branch mispredictions using bitwise operations, improving performance for large datasets. The execution times for both implementations are analyzed, showing that branchless QuickSort is faster for larger inputs
